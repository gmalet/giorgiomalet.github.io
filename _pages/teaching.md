I teach substantive classes on democracy, participation and populism as well as methods classes (and workshops) on text analysis, webscraping, computational social science and data journalism. Below, you can find a list of my current, upcoming and past courses. As far as possible, I try to make syllabi and course resources available on GitHub as I create them. If you are interested in my teaching evaluations, drop me an e-mail.
