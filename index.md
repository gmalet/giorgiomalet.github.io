I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of International Relations and Political Economy of the University of Zurich. Here I work on an ERC project on “The Mass Politics of Disintegration.” I completed my doctorate at the European University Institute with a thesis on the political consequences of mass Euroscepticism. During my PhD, I held visiting positions at the University of California, Berkeley and at the London School of Economics. At the EUI, I was also involved in an ERC project on “Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession.”
